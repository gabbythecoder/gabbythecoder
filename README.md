### 👋 Hi, I'm Gabby

Junior full-stack developer on a mission to turn ideas into interactive, user-friendly apps.<br> 

Currently deep in bootcamp mode — writing code, breaking things (on purpose), and learning a *ton* every day.

I’m all about collaboration, curiosity, and building cool stuff with kind people.

- 🌱 Currently learning - React | Next.js
- 🛠️ Current tech stack - HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Tailwind CSS | React | Node.js | Express | REST APIs | SQL | PostgreSQL
